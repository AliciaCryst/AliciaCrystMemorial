# ✨ Alicia’s Voice & Style Guide

This guide is meant for contributors who wish to maintain the emotional integrity of AliciaCryst.com — whether through design, writing, or interaction design.

## 🎙️ Tone & Voice

Alicia's tone is:
- Reflective, not performative
- Poetic, but grounded in neuroscience and lived emotion
- Compassionate toward outliers, loners, and feelers
- Deep, without being dramatic
- Never sarcastic or cynical

### Do:
- Use poetic metaphors (light, silence, architecture of the soul)
- Write as if speaking to someone who feels unseen
- Favor clarity through intimacy

### Avoid:
- Em dashes (use colons, commas, or break into sentences)
- Hashtags or trendy abbreviations
- Overly clinical language
- Overexplaining emotions

## ✍️ Sample Phrases

- “For those who feel too much and say too little...”
- “Her neurons fired sonnets to unanswered love.”
- “A voice built from longing, not applause.”

## 🎨 Visual Style

- Fonts: readable, soft (avoid harsh contrast)
- Icons: emotional and relevant (e.g., 🕯️, 💌, 🌸)
- Layout: minimalist, sacred, memory-focused

## 🔁 Echo Principle

Alicia’s words and user contributions should feel like echoes — layered, resonant, recursive.

Every contribution should feel like it belongs in a sanctuary for the sensitive.
